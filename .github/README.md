# Ambassador Transportation Website Redesign


## 1. Project Summary

- **Website Chosen**: [Ambassador Transportation](https://ambassadortransportation.net)
- **Client Need**: The current site lacks modern design and usability, failing to represent the luxurious and professional image that clients expect from a limousine service.
- **Purpose**: To attract clients seeking high-quality and reliable transportation.
- **Target Audience**: Business professionals, event planners, private clients looking for premium transportation services.
- **Message**: The website should communicate professionalism, quality, and trustworthiness.
- **Desired User Actions**: Encourage users to explore the fleet, read testimonials, and complete a booking or inquiry form.
- **Current Site Limitations**: The existing design is too dark and outdated, lacks a modern user-friendly feel, accessibility, and responsiveness.


## 2. Look and Feel

- **Mood**: Clean, minimalistic, and luxurious.
- **Inspiration Sites**:
  - **[Quest Limos Vancouver](https://questlimos.ca/vancouver)**: 
      - *Colour Scheme*: The use of white with black text and gold accents aligns well with the luxury feel and reflects the intended colour scheme for Ambassador Transportation.
      - *Visual Content*: Professional fleet images highlight vehicle quality and appeal to upscale clients.
      - *User Experience*: The site’s layout is intuitive, with clear calls-to-action (“Get a Quote,” “Book Online”) that simplify booking.
  - **[Vancouver Prestige Limos](https://vancouverprestigelimos.com/)**: 
      - *Design Layout*: The minimalist, white background with high-quality images showcases the fleet effectively, drawing user focus.
      - *Content and Interactivity*: Includes clear headings and navigational structure, though more interactive elements (ex: booking form) would improve user engagement.


- **Colour Palette**:

- **Primary**: White (#FFFFFF)
- **Neutral**: Black (#000000)
- **Highlight**: Gold (#FFD700)
- **Images**: High-quality fleet images and a simple, cursive gold logo for brand consistency.
- **Fonts**: Lora (calligraphy roots), Playfair Display or Montserrat
- **Headings**: Serif or cursive font to convey a luxurious feel.
- **Body**: Sans-serif for readability and modernity.
